Exercise3

Using what you have learned from the Modern Javascript course, upgrade the todo list to use the new language features in ES6.
 - Template Strings
 - Arrow functions
 - Classes/inheritance
 - let and const declarations
 - Object destructuring (hint, the item object)

Add jsdoc to your environment and use it to generate documentation for your classes and methods.

Break your classes into Modules.
