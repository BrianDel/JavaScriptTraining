10:20 Part 1: Learning Javascript.

 A history of Javascript 15 Mins https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWi9lPEfNHc
[15m]

 The course chosen is JavaBrains, mainly because it is very good, but also because it is free.
 Setup for JavaBrains course.
 - Follow the advice in the video (Mozilla and ScratchPad) unless you are more comfortable using something else.
 - Use the YouTube links instead of the JavaBrains.io site, as YouTube autoplays the next video, which is useful when the videos are quite short.
 - Recommend getting used to playing back at a higher speed if you are able to.

Part 2: Learning React
 Setup for React Course
 Use Atom.io as your IDE.
  - Add this plugin which will allow you run your terminal window in Atom, and see compile errors as you edit and save.
    apm install platformio-ide-terminal
    Restart Atom and open a terminal window using the Plugin menu, or you can click the small square icon with the ‘>’ near the bottom right.
  - Start your React App from within this terminal.
  - Now as you save (assuming you have setup the build with watchman as directed in the video) you will see the recompilation in the terminal window, and any failures that occur.
 Use Chrome as your Client side IDE
  - Keep DevTools Open
  - Install the React Plugin - you can do this when asked during the course
   - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en-GB

The most efficient way to work is to play-the-video/view-the-app on you laptop screen and code in Atom on your monitor with the terminal plug-ing. This avoids tabbing back and forth between applications
